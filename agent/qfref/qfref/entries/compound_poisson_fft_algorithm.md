# Compound Poisson aggregate loss by FFT: grid, discretization and tail measures

The task description inside <task_instructions> takes priority over this card: where it gives a different formula, a grid rule or a risk measure, follow the task description.

## Algorithm

Inputs: Poisson intensity $\lambda$, severity distribution $F$, grid size $n$, confidence levels.

1. Choose an initial range top at or above the percentile the task names, and set the grid step $h = \mathrm{top}/n$.
2. Discretize the severity by rounding: $f_0 = F(h/2)$ and $f_j = F((j + \tfrac12) h) - F((j - \tfrac12) h)$ for $j \ge 1$.
3. Get the aggregate probability mass on the grid $0, h, \dots, (n-1)h$ as the real part of the inverse FFT of $\exp(\lambda(\hat{f} - 1))$, where $\hat{f}$ is the FFT of $f$ (`numpy.fft.fft` and `numpy.fft.ifft`).
4. Compute VaR and ES on the grid.
5. Double the range (so $h$ doubles with $n$ fixed) and repeat steps 2-4 until VaR and ES change by less than a relative $10^{-3}$ between two doublings; keep the last result.
6. Report $h$, the range, the probability mass in the top 1% of the grid, and the mass of the severity lost beyond the grid.

The FFT is circular: aggregate probability beyond $n h$ wraps around and lands at small losses. A range that only just covers a high percentile is enough for VaR but not for ES with a heavy-tailed severity (lognormal, Pareto): the wrapped tail lowers ES. Step 5 is the check; the mass left in the top of the grid should be negligible.

## VaR and ES on a discrete grid

With grid points $x_i = i h$, pmf $g_i$, cdf $c_i$ and level $p$: $\mathrm{VaR}_p = x_k$ with $k$ the first index where $c_k \ge p$, and
$$\mathrm{ES}_p = \frac{1}{1-p}\left[\sum_{i>k} g_i x_i + (c_k - p)\, x_k\right]$$
If <task_instructions> defines ES as $E[S \mid S > \mathrm{VaR}_p]$, use $\sum_{i>k} g_i x_i / (1 - c_k)$ instead and say so.

## Checks

1. The aggregate mean $\sum_i g_i x_i$ is close to $\lambda E[X]$ when the severity mean is finite.
2. VaR and ES are stable when the range is doubled.
3. Monte Carlo values agree within their sampling error; heavy tails make the Monte Carlo ES noisy, so compare against its standard error rather than a fixed percentage.
