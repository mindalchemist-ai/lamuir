# Local volatility from an implied-volatility surface

The task description inside <task_instructions> takes priority over this card: where it gives a different formula, input or convention, follow the task description.

## Topic: Local variance from total variance (Gatheral form)

**Purpose:** Compute the local variance $\sigma_{loc}^2(k,T)$ from a smooth implied total variance surface $w(k,T)=\sigma_{imp}^2(k,T)\,T$.

**When to use:** The implied volatility surface is available as a smooth function of log-moneyness and maturity (for example a fitted parametric slice per maturity, interpolated in $T$). Use the call-price form instead when only option prices are available.

**How to implement:** With $k=\ln(K/F_T)$, $F_T$ the forward for maturity $T$, and derivatives taken with respect to $k$ at fixed $T$:

$$g(k)=\Big(1-\frac{k\,w_k}{2w}\Big)^2-\frac{w_k^2}{4}\Big(\frac1w+\frac14\Big)+\frac{w_{kk}}{2},\qquad \sigma_{loc}^2(k,T)=\frac{w_T}{g(k)}.$$

Take $w_T$ at fixed $k$. Compute $w_k$, $w_{kk}$ analytically from the parametric slice when possible, otherwise by central differences on a fine grid in $k$.

**Implementation tips:**

1. Positive local variance is not something to enforce afterwards: it follows from two no-arbitrage properties of the input surface. Check both before differentiating. Calendar: $w(k,T)$ is non-decreasing in $T$ at fixed $k$, which makes $w_T\ge0$. Butterfly: each maturity slice satisfies the convexity condition that keeps $g(k)>0$ (for a parametric slice, verify it on the fitted parameters, not only on the quoted strikes).
2. Compute $w_T$ at fixed $k$ from the fitted parametric slices, not from finite differences on a sparse maturity grid: a central difference across widely spaced maturities, or a one-sided difference at the first and last maturity, is where a spurious negative $w_T$ comes from. Extrapolate $w$ linearly in $T$ at fixed $k$ beyond the last maturity, and evaluate at small positive $T$, never $T=0$.
3. If local variance is still non-positive at a node, repair the surface (re-fit the slice under the no-arbitrage constraints, or restrict the $k$ grid to the quoted range so the wings come from the fit rather than from extrapolation rather than extrapolation) instead of clipping the result. Print the unclipped minimum of $g(k)$ and $w_T$ over the grid and report which node fails.

**Limitations and cautions:**

1. Use $k=\ln(K/F_T)$ in the formula, not the strike $K$ and not $K/S_0$.
2. Derivatives are with respect to $k$, not $K$; $w_T$ is at fixed $k$, not fixed $K$.
3. Clipping $g$ or the variance to a small positive number hides a wrong formula; look at the unclipped values first.
4. A negative $g$ or $w_T$ means arbitrage in the surface (calendar or butterfly) or a numerical derivative on a coarse grid.

**Double check:**

1. For a flat surface ($w=\sigma^2T$ with constant $\sigma$), $\sigma_{loc}=\sigma$ at every point.
2. Near the money, $\sigma_{loc}$ is of the same order as $\sigma_{imp}$; a ratio far from 1 at all points points to a formula or unit error.
3. Print the unclipped minimum of $g$ and $w_T$ before clipping.

## Topic: Local variance from call prices (Dupire form)

**Purpose:** Compute the local variance directly from call prices $C(K,T)$.

**When to use:** Option prices (or prices from a smooth pricing model) are the primary input and a total variance surface is not available.

**How to implement:** With risk-free rate $r$ and dividend yield $q$,

$$\sigma_{loc}^2(K,T)=\frac{C_T+(r-q)\,K\,C_K+q\,C}{\tfrac12 K^2\,C_{KK}}.$$

Compute $C_T$, $C_K$, $C_{KK}$ analytically from a smooth model, or by finite differences on a smooth price surface.

**Limitations and cautions:**

1. Finite differences of noisy market prices give unstable $C_{KK}$; smooth the surface first.
2. $C_{KK}$ near zero (deep in or out of the money) makes the ratio explode; restrict to the region where $C_{KK}$ is well above numerical noise.
3. The dividend and rate terms must match the convention used to build the prices.

**Double check:**

1. The result is positive wherever the prices are arbitrage-free.
2. Re-pricing a European option with the resulting local volatility surface reproduces the input prices within the numerical error.

## Topic: Monte Carlo under a local-volatility surface

Once $\sigma_{\mathrm{loc}}(t, K)$ is known on a grid of maturities $t_{1} < \dots < t_{m}$ and strikes $K_{1} < \dots < K_{n}$, a path is simulated by reading the local volatility at the path's current time and level.

**Log-Euler step** (time in years, $\Delta t$ the sub-step, $Z$ standard normal):

$$
\ln S_{t+\Delta t} = \ln S_{t} + \left(r - q - \tfrac{1}{2} \sigma_{\mathrm{loc}}(t, S_{t})^{2}\right) \Delta t + \sigma_{\mathrm{loc}}(t, S_{t}) \sqrt{\Delta t} \, Z
$$

Simulate the forward instead of the spot only when the task does; then the drift term is $-\tfrac{1}{2}\sigma^{2}\Delta t$ and the start is the forward.

**Reading the surface**
- The grid axis is strike; read it at the path level $S_{t}$ (or at log-moneyness if the surface is stored that way), with $t$ in the same units as the grid's maturity axis. Build the interpolator's time axis from each expiry's time to maturity in years, never from a label or timestamp column, and run `assert np.allclose(t_axis, ttm_by_expiry) and t_axis.max() <= T + 1e-9`; print the share of path steps whose time was clamped to the axis ends. An output column named like an input label (an expiry, a tenor) holds that label as the inputs or the configuration spell it, not a timestamp derived from it: `assert set(df[col]) <= set(allowed)` with `allowed` read from the input or configuration list.
- Paths leave the grid: before the first maturity and outside the strike range. Extend the surface flat in each direction (clamp $t$ to $[t_{1}, t_{m}]$ and $S_{t}$ to $[K_{1}, K_{n}]$ before interpolating). Do not return a missing value and replace it with an average volatility: that ignores the smile exactly where barrier and tail paths go.
- Interpolate the stored quantity the task prescribes (local variance or local volatility); if none is prescribed, interpolating local variance linearly in time keeps total variance increasing.

**Discrete monitoring and variance reduction**
- With several sub-steps per monitoring date, test the barrier only on the monitoring dates (for example each daily close), not on every sub-step.
- Antithetic pairs use $Z$ and $-Z$ for the same path index; the standard error comes from the pair averages, not from the $2N$ individual payoffs.

**Checks**
- The vanilla price from the same simulation should agree with the call price on the surface (the surface the local volatility was extracted from) within a few standard errors plus the discretisation error. A gap of tens of percent is a bug in the simulation, not Monte Carlo noise.
- Flat test: replace the surface by a constant $\sigma$; the simulated vanilla must match Black–Scholes. If it does not, the error is in the time step, the drift or the discounting, not in the surface.
- Compare the local volatility read at the start (time near 0, level near spot) with the at-the-money implied volatility; they should be of the same size.
- A knock-out price must not exceed the vanilla price from the same paths.
