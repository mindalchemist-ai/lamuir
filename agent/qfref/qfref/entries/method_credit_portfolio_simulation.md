# Method: portfolio credit loss by Monte Carlo rating migration (CreditMetrics, one-factor Gaussian copula)

The task description inside <task_instructions> takes priority over this card: where it gives a different formula, input, setting or convention, follow the task description.

Read the topics relevant to the task; a task usually needs several of them.

## Topic 1: Rating thresholds from a transition row

**Purpose:** Turn one row of migration probabilities into standard normal band edges for the latent variable.

**When to use:** Correlated rating migrations or defaults of a bond portfolio are simulated from a rating transition matrix with a one-factor Gaussian copula.

**Constraints:**

1. Ratings are ordered from best to worst with Default last, as in a transition matrix row.
2. The standard convention, from the Merton model behind CreditMetrics, puts default in the lowest band: an obligor defaults when its asset return falls below the default threshold, and higher latent values mean better ratings. Use it unless the task explicitly puts default in the highest band. Both directions give the same migration probabilities, but the same random draws give different paths, so a reversed direction changes every simulated loss.

**How to implement:**

Step 1: Normalize the row of the bond's initial rating so it sums to one.

Step 2: Cumulative probability from the worst rating upwards: for each rating $k$, $c_k=P(\text{new rating is }k\text{ or worse})$, computed by a reversed cumulative sum (`np.cumsum` on the reversed row).

Step 3: Band edges (default in the lowest band): $e_k=N^{-1}(c_k)$ for the boundaries between consecutive ratings (`scipy.stats.norm.ppf`, with the probabilities clipped to $[0,1]$); the edges are descending. Drop the cumulative value that equals 1 (it would give an edge of $+\infty$, below which every latent value falls): $K$ ratings have exactly $K-1$ finite edges. Assert `len(edges) == K - 1` and `np.isfinite(edges).all()`, and that the mapped index of Step 4 runs from 0 (best) to $K-1$ (Default).

Step 4: Mapping: the new rating index (0 = best) of a latent value $Z$ is the number of edges that $Z$ falls below.

Step 5: Statistics by initial rating: with losses or default flags stored as (simulations, bonds), select the columns of that rating's bonds, `x[:, idx]`, not the rows `x[idx]`; the default probability of a rating is the mean of its default flags over all simulations and its bonds.

**Limitations and cautions:**

1. A zero probability in the row gives two equal edges (an empty band); a probability of one for Default gives an edge of $+\infty$. Both are valid, so keep them rather than dropping the rating.

**Double check:**

1. Over many simulations, the frequency of each new rating for a bond is close to its transition row.

## Topic 2: Simulating correlated migrations

**Purpose:** Draw the systematic factor and idiosyncratic shocks and map every bond to a new rating.

**When to use:** After Topic 1, for every simulation and bond.

**Constraints:**

1. Use the random generator, draw order and array shapes the task names; when it gives only a seed, state the choice. Each choice is a valid sample, but the estimates differ by sampling noise.
2. Draw the simulation once from one seeded stream, store the arrays and derive every output from them. Diagnostics and tests never reseed or draw from that stream; they use a separate local `np.random.default_rng(other_seed)`.

**How to implement:**

Step 1: Choose the generator and order: `np.random.seed(seed)` with the legacy global functions, or `rng = np.random.default_rng(seed)`; the factor for all simulations first and then the shock matrix, or both per simulation; the shock matrix shaped (simulations, bonds) or transposed.

Step 2: Latent values for all simulations and bonds at once (matrix form, factor broadcast across bonds):

$$Z_{s,j}=\sqrt\rho\,M_s+\sqrt{1-\rho}\,\varepsilon_{s,j}$$

Step 3: New ratings: compare each bond's column of $Z$ with that bond's edges (broadcast the edges against the column and count, `(Z[:, j, None] < edges[None, :]).sum(axis=1)`); loop over bonds only, never over simulations.

Step 4: Loss per bond and simulation, by the loss definition the task uses:

1. Default mode: only defaults lose, $(1-R)\cdot\text{face}$.
2. Mark-to-market: every migration revalues the bond with the forward value for its new rating, so downgrades also lose. Use it when the task supplies forward values or spread curves by rating.

Step 5: Portfolio loss per simulation: the sum over bonds.

Step 6: Before computing any risk figure, print for each initial rating the simulated frequency of every new rating next to its input transition row (Double check 2) and fix the edges or the mapping if any entry is off by more than $4\sqrt{p(1-p)/n}$.

**Limitations and cautions:**

1. One common factor gives the same asset correlation $\rho$ to every pair of bonds; sector or region structure needs a multi-factor model, which the task must define.

**Double check:**

1. For each group of bonds with the same initial rating, the simulated default frequency over all bond-simulation pairs is close to the default probability in the transition row; in default mode, one bond's mean loss equals $(1-R)\cdot\text{face}$ times that frequency.
2. Print, for each initial rating, the simulated frequency of every new rating next to the input transition row; if any entry differs by more than $4\sqrt{p(1-p)/n}$ ($n$ bond-simulation pairs of that rating), the edges or the mapping are wrong: fix them and simulate again.
3. The per-rating (or per-category) mean losses add up to the portfolio mean loss within $10^{-9}$; if not, the outputs come from different draws.

## Topic 3: VaR and ES of the simulated loss

**Purpose:** Report quantile-based risk measures of a discrete loss distribution.

**When to use:** Loss quantiles and expected shortfall of the simulated portfolio loss.

**Constraints:**

1. Average the losses at or above the VaR to get ES, unless the task writes a strict inequality or the word "strictly"; "beyond VaR" and "exceeding VaR" are not such a request. Use the Acerbi-Tasche weighted tail mean when the task asks for the coherent or integrated-quantile form.

**How to implement:**

Step 1: VaR with the quantile method the task names: `np.quantile(L, level, method=...)` with linear interpolation (the numpy default), `"lower"`, `"higher"` or `"inverted_cdf"`; otherwise the library default, stated.

Step 2: ES: the mean of $L$ over the simulations with $L\ge\mathrm{VaR}$.

Step 3: Print the probability mass exactly at the VaR, and the strict mean ($L>\mathrm{VaR}$) as a diagnostic only.

**Limitations and cautions:**

1. With defaults only, losses take few values and ties at the VaR carry probability, so the readings can differ by one loss step.

**Double check:**

1. ES is at least the VaR.

## Topic 4: Losses by category and migration rates

**Purpose:** Break the loss down by category (initial rating, sector, region) and report migration frequencies.

**When to use:** The task asks for a loss table by category or for upgrade, downgrade and default rates.

**Constraints:**

1. A loss table broken down by category, in the same unit as the portfolio loss, reports each category's contribution: the category total, averaged over simulations, so that the rows add up to the portfolio mean loss. Divide by the number of bonds only when the wording asks for a per-bond, per-obligor or average-bond figure; an input stated per bond (a notional, a recovery amount) does not ask for it.

**How to implement:**

Step 1: For each category, sum the loss over its bonds in each simulation, then average over simulations.

Step 2: One bond's mean loss, when asked: the category total divided by its number of bonds.

Step 3: Migration rates over all bond-simulation pairs: the share that moved up the rating scale (upgrade), moved down without defaulting (downgrade), and defaulted. Compare in the (simulations, bonds) shape, `new_idx < init_idx[None, :]` for upgrades; when flattening, pair `new_idx.ravel()` with `np.tile(init_idx, n_sim)`, not `np.repeat`.

**Limitations and cautions:**

1. With few bonds in a category its mean loss is noisy; the sampling error shrinks only with more simulations.

**Double check:**

1. The category rows add up to the portfolio mean loss; if not, a per-bond figure was reported where a total was meant.
2. The upgrade rate is close to the average over bonds of the transition-row probabilities of better ratings, and likewise for downgrades and defaults; a gap larger than sampling noise means new and initial ratings are misaligned.
