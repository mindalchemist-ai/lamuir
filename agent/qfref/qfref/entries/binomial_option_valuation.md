# Binomial valuation and exercise opportunities

The task description inside <task_instructions> takes priority over this card: where it gives a different formula, input, setting or convention, follow the task description.

## Check first: carry rate b, rate r and yield q

Many option texts write the drift with a cost-of-carry rate b instead of a yield. The three are tied by b = r - q:

| underlying | carry b | yield q = r - b |
|---|---|---|
| stock without dividends | r | 0 |
| stock or index with continuous yield q | r - q | q |
| futures or forward contract | 0 | r |
| foreign currency (foreign rate r_f) | r - r_f | r_f |

On a CRR tree the expected one-step growth of the underlying is exp(b * dt) = exp((r - q) * dt), and every step is discounted with exp(-r * dt). So the up-probability is p = (exp(b * dt) - d) / (u - d). A factor exp((r - b) * dt) is exp(q * dt): it grows the underlying at the yield, not at the carry. When a task gives b, convert it once to q = r - b and use the rest of this note unchanged.

Before pricing an American option, price a European option on the same tree with b = r (no yield) and compare it with Black-Scholes; then repeat with the task's b against the Black-Scholes price with yield q = r - b.

1. Cox-Ross-Rubinstein tree with $n$ steps, $\Delta t = T/n$, $u = e^{\sigma\sqrt{\Delta t}}$, $d = 1/u$.
2. Risk-neutral up probability at the cost of carry $b$ (not at $r - b$): $p = (e^{b\Delta t} - d)/(u - d)$; $b = r$ with no yield, $b = 0$ for futures, $b = r - q$ with a continuous yield $q$.
3. Terminal prices $S u^{n-j} d^{j}$ for $j = 0, \dots, n$, with the payoff at each.
4. European value: step back with $V = e^{-r\Delta t}(p V_{\mathrm{up}} + (1-p) V_{\mathrm{down}})$.
5. American value: at each earlier time, rebuild the node prices of that time in the same order, step back as above, then take the maximum with immediate exercise against the node's own price.
6. Checks: with a few thousand steps the European tree price is within about 0.02 of Black-Scholes with dividend yield $r - b$, for calls and puts and for $b = r$, $b = 0$ and a positive yield; with no yield the American call equals the European call.

Use this reference for a CRR stock-price tree and European, Bermudan or American exercise under constant rates, continuous dividend yield and volatility. It supplies numerical pricing mathematics, not a replacement for a specifically requested PDE or analytical approximation.

## Conventions and notation

Explicit task definitions take precedence. S0 is current stock price, K is strike, r is the continuously compounded rate, q is continuous dividend yield, $\sigma  > 0$ is annualized volatility, $T > 0$ is remaining maturity, and n is the number of equal time intervals. Rates and volatility are decimal quantities. Node (i,j) means time i*dt and j upward moves, with $0 \le  j \le  i$. Cash dividends require separate event treatment and are not equivalent to a constant q.

## Transition model

Time interval:

$$
\mathrm{d}t = T/n
$$

CRR upward and downward stock multipliers:

$$
\begin{gathered}
u = \exp (\sigma \cdot \sqrt{\mathrm{d}t}) \\
d = 1/u
\end{gathered}
$$

Stock price at a recombining node:

$$
S_{i,j} = \mathrm{S0} \cdot  u^{j} \cdot  d^{i-j}
$$

The pricing probability matches the stock's risk-neutral growth after continuous dividend yield:

$$
p = (\exp ((r-q)\cdot \mathrm{d}t)-d)/(u-d)
$$

An arbitrage-free nondegenerate step requires $d < \exp ((r-q)\cdot \mathrm{d}t) < u$. A probability outside [0,1] indicates an invalid discretization; clipping changes the model. This probability is unrelated to an estimated historical upward-return frequency.

## Payoffs and stopping

Call exercise payoff:

$$
g_{\mathrm{call}}(S) = \max (S-K,0)
$$

Put exercise payoff:

$$
g_{\mathrm{put}}(S) = \max (K-S,0)
$$

Terminal value for the selected payoff g:

$$
V_{n,j} = g(S_{n,j})
$$

Continuation value H at an earlier node:

$$
H_{i,j} = \exp (-r\cdot \mathrm{d}t) \cdot  [p\cdot V_{i+1,j+1} + (1-p)\cdot V_{i+1,j}]
$$

Value when exercise is permitted at that node:

$$
V_{i,j} = \max (g(S_{i,j}),H_{i,j})
$$

Value when exercise is not permitted:

$$
V_{i,j} = H_{i,j}
$$

European exercise is only at expiry; Bermudan exercise uses specified dates; American tree exercise is available at every time node. The latter approximates continuous exercise as the time spacing shrinks. An exercise boundary represents positive exercise payoff that dominates continuation; zero-payoff ties are not evidence of economic early exercise.

## Checks and limits

On the same tree and contract, adding exercise opportunities cannot lower value. A non-dividend-paying call with nonnegative interest rates equals its European counterpart. European call-put parity holds on the tree. Convergence to a diffusion price can oscillate as strike alignment changes; more time steps need not improve every individual error monotonically.

At $\sigma =0$ the stock path is deterministic and the probability formula is singular: value follows from discounted contractual cash flows and allowed exercise times. At expiry the value is the payoff. The plain stock-only state does not retain running extrema or averages, so it is insufficient for path-dependent payoffs without additional state.

## Source and derivation

[Cox, Ross and Rubinstein (1979), Option Pricing: A Simplified Approach](https://bpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/u.osu.edu/dist/7/36891/files/2017/07/CRR79-1yy8av8.pdf), sections 3, 5 and 6: recombining valuation, diffusion limit and early exercise. The continuous-yield probability here follows directly from $p\cdot u+(1-p)\cdot d=\exp ((r-q)\cdot \mathrm{d}t)$; notation uses continuous annual rates rather than the paper's one-period gross return.
